## üé® Visualization Features

### Sensitivity Control

- Default value (1.0): Balanced response
- Higher values (2.0-5.0): Intense, dramatic effects

### Fullscreen Mode

- In fullscreen, all playback shortcuts still work
- Press **Esc** or **F9** again to exit
- Fullscreen visualization on separate screen works perfectly

### Visualization Modes Detailed

**Analysis-Based**
- **Fourier Transform**: Real mathematical frequency analysis
- **Bars/Trippy Bars**: Classic frequency spectrum display

**Physics Simulations**
- **Bouncy Balls**: Real physics with gravity and collisions
- **Ripples**: Wave interference patterns
- **Block Stack**: Tetris-style stacking mechanics

**Game/Puzzle Solvers**
- **Sudoku**: Watches real sudoku solving algorithm (CPU-intensive, may cause brief pauses)
- **Tower of Hanoi**: Classic recursive puzzle solution
- **Beat Chess**: Stockfish chess AI playing to music (CPU-intensive)
- **Beat Checkers**: AI checkers with beat-synced moves (CPU-intensive)

**Artistic Effects**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

**Missing pkg-config files**: 
```bash
# Check if libraries are properly installed
pkg-config --list-all | grep gtk
pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-3.0
```

**SDL2 not found**:
```bash
# Verify SDL2 installation
sdl2-config --version
pkg-config --libs sdl2
```

**ffmpeg not found (Linux)**:
```bash
# Install ffmpeg development packages
sudo apt install ffmpeg libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev
```

**Windows cross-compilation fails**:
```bash
# Check MinGW installation
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc --version
mingw64-pkg-config --version
```

### Runtime Issues

**No audio output**: 
- Check SDL2 can initialize audio: `SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver()`
- Verify volume isn't muted in system mixer
- On Linux, check PulseAudio/ALSA configuration

**MIDI files sound wrong**: 
This is expected! OPL3 synthesis recreates classic FM synthesis, not modern General MIDI. It's authentic 1990s sound.

**Missing DLLs on Windows**: 
The build process should collect required DLLs automatically. Check the `build/windows/` directory.

**Karaoke files won't load**:
- Ensure ZIP contains both audio and .cdg files
- For LRC files, matching audio file must exist in same directory
- Check console output for conversion errors

**Visualizations lag or stutter**:
- Reduce sensitivity slider
- Close other applications using GPU
- Note: Beat Chess uses ~100% CPU (multi-threaded by design)
- Note: Sudoku and Beat Checkers are CPU-intensive
- Sudoku solver may cause brief pauses (not multi-threaded)
- Minimizing the window reduces CPU usage to ~3%

**Queue filter not working**:
- Filter searches: filename, title, artist, album, genre
- Search is case-insensitive
- Clear filter with backspace/delete

### Fullscreen Visualization Tips

For the best fullscreen experience:
- Use dedicated display/monitor when possible
- Disable screen savers and power management
- Close unnecessary background applications
- Higher sensitivity values create more dramatic effects

## üí≠ Design Philosophy

Zenamp does everything a local audio player should do, without compromise:

- **No Cloud**: Your music, your computer, your control
- **No Telemetry**: What you play is private
- **No Subscriptions**: Free forever, truly free
- **No Compromise**: Full features, not "lite" versions

The interface shows you what matters:
- Your queue is visible, not buried in menus
- Controls are obvious, not "intuitive" gestures
- Progress bar actually seeks, not just decorative
- Visualizations immerse, not distract

Revolutionary concepts: a music player that respects your music collection and your intelligence.

## üéÆ Technical Details

### Virtual File System
Most format conversions happen in memory using a virtual file system:
- Audio format conversions cached in RAM
- CD+G ZIP extraction uses temporary disk space
- LRC to karaoke conversion uses temporary disk space
- Instant file switching (cached conversions)
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files
- Automatic cleanup on exit

### Audio Pipeline
1. Files loaded and converted to 16-bit PCM WAV format
2. Audio passes through 10-band equalizer
3. Speed adjustment applied (time-stretching algorithm)
4. Volume scaling
5. Data fed to SDL2 audio callback and visualizer
6. Real-time frequency analysis for visualizations

### MIDI Synthesis
OPL3 emulation provides authentic FM synthesis:
- 18 operator channels
- Real-time parameter changes
- Authentic instrument patches from Sound Blaster era
- Period-correct sound characteristics
- No General MIDI‚Äîjust raw FM synthesis

### Karaoke Engine
- **CD+G Parser**: Full SubCode packet interpretation
- **LRC Converter**: Automatic lyric timing extraction
- **Sync Engine**: Frame-accurate subtitle synchronization
- **Rendering**: Cairo-based high-quality text rendering

### Visualization Architecture
- Real-time FFT-like frequency analysis (simplified)
- 30+ independent visualization modules
- Audio-reactive particle systems
- Fullscreen optimization with VSync
- Scales to playback speed automatically

### Equalizer Implementation
- Butterworth filter design
- Real-time coefficient recalculation
- Per-sample processing with minimal latency
- Preset system with JSON storage

## üìä Performance Characteristics

**Memory Usage**:
- Base: ~30-50 MB
- Per cached file: ~10-50 MB (depends on length)
- Visualization: +5-15 MB
- Typical total: 50-150 MB

**CPU Usage**:
- Idle/Stopped: <1%
- Playing (most visualizations): 10-20% depending on complexity
- Playing (Beat Chess): ~100% (multi-threaded)
- Minimized while playing: ~3%

**Supported File Sizes**:
- Tested up to 2 hour audio files
- Queue size: Unlimited (memory permitting)
- Playlist size: Unlimited

## üéØ Known Limitations

- No streaming audio (by design‚Äîlocal files only)
- No video playback (audio player, not media player)
- Sudoku visualization not multi-threaded (may cause brief pauses during solving)
- Beat Chess uses ~100% CPU (multi-threaded, aggressive computation)
- Beat Checkers is CPU-intensive
- Chess/Checkers AI difficulty fixed (for consistent beat sync)
- Windows M4A/WMA support requires Windows 7+ codecs

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Considerations

- **Visualization Plugin System**: Optional modular architecture allowing community contributions of custom visualizations without modifying core code
- **More Visualizations**: Additional visualizations will be added over time

Feature suggestions are welcomed! See the Reporting Issues section below for how to contribute ideas.
