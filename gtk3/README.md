# üé∂ Zenamp

A minimalist music/audio player that doesn't mess around. Built with GTK3 and SDL2, this is your no-nonsense jukebox that happens to have excellent taste in both modern formats and retro MIDI synthesis.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üéß Full Playback Control**  
  Play, pause, stop, rewind/fast-forward (5-second jumps), and skip between tracks. All the buttons you actually need, none of the bloat you don't.

- **üìú Visual Queue Management**  
  Add multiple files, see what's playing, remove tracks individually, drag-and-drop reordering, and toggle repeat mode. The queue is right there where you can see it‚Äîno hidden mysteries.  It is also filterable and sortable.

- **üîä Flexible Volume Control**  
  Scale from whisper-quiet (10%) to surprisingly loud (300%) with a smooth slider that actually responds to your input.

- **‚è±Ô∏è Progress Tracking**  
  Draggable progress bar with real-time timestamps. Know where you are, jump to where you want to be.

- **üé® Audio Visualization**  
  Real-time visual representation of your music with multiple visualization modes:
  - Bubbles visualization
  - Matrix-style effects
  - Fireworks display
  - DNA helix patterns
  - Sudoku Solver
  - More as I have time

Press F9 for fullscreen visualization mode

- **üéöÔ∏è 10-Band Equalizer**  
  Fine-tune your audio with a professional-grade equalizer covering frequencies from 31Hz to 16kHz.

- **üìù Playlist Support**  
  Load and save M3U playlists. Organize your music collections and share them easily.

- **üéµ Comprehensive Format Support**  
  - **WAV** ‚Äî Direct playback, no conversion needed
  - **MP3** ‚Äî Decoded to WAV in memory using advanced audio conversion
  - **OGG Vorbis** ‚Äî Converted on-the-fly with libvorbis
  - **FLAC** ‚Äî Lossless audio, handled gracefully with libFLAC
  - **AIFF** (.aif/.aiff) ‚Äî Mac's answer to WAV files
  - **OPUS** (.opus) ‚Äî Open-source, royalty-free, low-latency audio codec
  - **MIDI** (.mid/.midi) ‚Äî Here's where it gets interesting...
  - **M4A/AAC** - Advanced Codec (Different methods for Windows and Linux)
  - **WMA** - Windows Media Audio (Different methods for Windows and Linux)
  - **CDG** - CD+G files/karaoke files
  - **Generic Files** - Whatever is supported via libavcodec on Linux and natively on Windows *should* work (I opened a MP4 of Alien Romulus and it loaded the audio)

## üéπ The MIDI Magic

This player includes **real-time OPL3 synthesis** for MIDI files. That means your `.mid` files get processed through an emulated Yamaha OPL3 chip‚Äîthe same sound generator that powered classic DOS games and early PC audio cards.

Want to hear what your favorite MIDI sounded like on a 1990s Sound Blaster? Now you can. It's nerdy, it's nostalgic, and it sounds exactly like you remember (or wish you could remember).

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

**Missing pkg-config files**: 
```bash
# Check if libraries are properly installed
pkg-config --list-all | grep gtk
pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-3.0
```

**SDL2 not found**:
```bash
# Verify SDL2 installation
sdl2-config --version
pkg-config --libs sdl2
```

**Windows cross-compilation fails**:
```bash
# Check MinGW installation
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc --version
mingw64-pkg-config --version
```

### Runtime Issues

**No audio output**: Check that SDL2 can initialize your audio system and that volume isn't muted.

**MIDI files sound wrong**: This is expected! The OPL3 synthesis intentionally recreates classic FM synthesis sound, not modern General MIDI.

**Missing DLLs on Windows**: The build process should collect required DLLs automatically. If manual collection is needed, check the MinGW installation directory.

## üí≠ Design Philosophy

This player does one thing well: plays your local audio files without fuss. No streaming APIs, no cloud integration, no telemetry, no subscription prompts. Just you, your music collection, and a player that gets out of the way.

The interface is clean but not minimalist to a fault‚Äîyou can see your queue, control playback intuitively, and the progress bar actually lets you seek to specific positions. Revolutionary concepts, apparently.

## üéÆ Technical Details

### Virtual File System
Format conversions happen in memory using a virtual file system, so your disk doesn't get cluttered with temporary files. Conversions are cached for improved performance on repeated playback.

### Audio Pipeline
1. Files are loaded and converted to 16-bit PCM WAV format
2. Audio passes through the 10-band equalizer
3. Volume scaling is applied
4. Data is fed to both the SDL2 audio callback and visualizer
5. Real-time visualization processes frequency domain data

### MIDI Synthesis
The OPL3 emulation provides authentic FM synthesis with:
- 18 operator channels
- Real-time parameter changes
- Authentic instrument patches
- Period-correct sound characteristics
